# ML-bachelor-course-labs-sp24
Labs for the Machine Learning bachelor course @ USI SP 24

This repository contains the code files for the Machine Learning Bachelor Course lab sessions for the Spring 2024 semester. Here, you will find the code used in each lab session, organised by topic and lab number.

## Course Information

**Course director**: Alippi Cesare

**Assistants**:

- [Dei Rossi Alvise](mailto:alvise.dei.rossi@usi.ch)
- [Ezzeddine Fatima](mailto:fatima.ezzeddine@usi.ch)
- [Manenti Alessandro](mailto:alessandro.manenti@usi.ch)

**Course description**: The course will address the following topics: Supervised learning: linear and nonlinear models for regression and prediction, statistical theory of learning, feature extraction and model selection. Deep learning: architectures including autoencoders, convolutional neural networks and learning procedures. Model performance assessment: cross-validation, k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out, bootstrap. Unsupervised learning: K-means clustering, fuzzy C-means, principal component analysis.

**Course objectives**: Students will learn how to design linear and nonlinear models for regression, prediction and classification as well as soundly assess their performance. At the same time, students will learn how to use deep learning architectures and learning algorithms in key real-world applications.

**Learning methods**: Lab sessions will focus on practical aspects and show how to design an appropriate machine learning solution to real-world problems. Basics in Calculus, Probability and Statics are requested.
